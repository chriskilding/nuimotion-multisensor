# nuimotion-multisensor
@bengfarrell's nuimotion for a multi-sensor setup.

## Dependencies
You will need to have OpenNI2 and NiTE2 .so files installed under /usr/lib for this to compile and run. After you have obtained them just run `npm install` and nuimotion will be pulled in, automatically compiled with `node-gyp`, and installed correctly.
